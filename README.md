# landing-page

This project is a simple landing page. I used flexbox for most elements, and most of the styling/html is very messy, but it looks nice overall.
I didn't spend too much time on this project as I want to keep moving forward in the curriculum, however this was a good way to brush up on
my HTML/CSS basics.
